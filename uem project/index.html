        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Uttor Majumdar, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. I have a deep passion for technology and its potential to transform the world. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and finding innovative solutions, which drives my interest in AI and machine learning. I am particularly fascinated by how these technologies can be applied to real-world issues, such as improving healthcare, enhancing user experiences, and automating processes.</p>
        <p>In addition to my studies, I actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills through online courses and workshops. I am currently enrolled in various courses on NPTEL and LinkedIn Learning, where I am honing my expertise in data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and software development. I believe in lifelong learning and am always eager to explore new concepts and technologies. Outside of academics, I enjoy participating in tech-related events and hackathons, which allow me to collaborate with like-minded individuals and apply my skills in practical settings. I am also an advocate for ethical AI and strive to understand the societal implications of technology. As I continue my journey in computer science, I am excited to contribute to impactful projects and engage with the tech community. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, as I work towards making a positive difference through technology.</p>
